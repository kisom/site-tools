sw - suckless webframework
==========================
sw is a minimal and sane web framework.

Installation
------------
Run:
	make && make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Configuration
-------------
Copy sw.conf and style.css to your working directory, and edit them to fit your needs.

Static web generation
---------------------
Run from your working directory:
	sw /path/to/site

Where 'site' is the folder where your website is located.
The static version of the website is created under 'site.static'.

Automatic generation+upload
---------------------------
The whole process can be automatized if you create a Makefile like this in your working directory:

$ cat Makefile
all:
	sw /path/to/site
	rsync -avz site.static/ foo.org:/path/to/wwwroot/
clean:
	rm -rf site.static
